Udemy courses are fun!

During Christmas I think I spent a ridiculous amount of money on Udemy courses because it was a bargain!

All these courses reflect what I would like to train/work with in the future!

Tech Courses:

JavaScript
Node.js
React with Redux
Vue JS 2
Angular 5
APIs with GraphQL

Advanced (for me) tech courses:

Linux
Unity
React VR
C#
A-Frame & WebVR

Random general courses that reflect my interests:

Photography
Spanish Language
Music Theory
Voice Acting

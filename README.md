**COVID-19 March 2020 update**

Amidst the unprecedent developments and chaos of the COVID-19 outbreak it is time to reflect and improve while staying at home.

It is up to us to see opportunity to grow (personally and professionally) within tragedy. Growth is our only means of survival.

I still feel that JavaScript is something I don't grasp fully so I will be starting off with the relevant courses I have on it.

Random general courses that reflect my interests:
